dynamic programming
      it is a problem solving technique when a big task is given we break it into multiple smaller tasks and find out solutions

 greedy approach
     unlike dynamic programming approach as the word saya it is greedy when we get first solution for task greedy will not analys
     efficient solution or not

#note
  in dynamic programming decisions will be taken in every stage while solving the problem or task
